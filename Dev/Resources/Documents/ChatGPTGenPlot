The lights were bright, glaring down on the studio set made to look like a cozy 90’s family living room. Audience members filled the seats, excited for the live taping of The Fullest House, a parody sitcom where cheesy one-liners and heartwarming family moments were the usual fare. But tonight, the air felt different, thick with a sense of something off—something cold that the studio lights couldn’t quite cut through.

In the center of it all was David, the actor who played the father, his normally warm and inviting expression replaced by a dark, empty stare. He had been mumbling to himself between takes, his eyes distant, pupils dilated. The crew had brushed it off as pre-show jitters, though he’d been a seasoned actor for years. Little did they know, David had been acting strangely for weeks, complaining of “bad dreams” and “hearing voices” on the set.

The director called for the cameras to roll, and the scene began. David’s character was supposed to deliver a heartfelt talk to his TV family about sticking together. But instead, he started muttering something unintelligible, his voice dipping into a guttural growl. Confused, the actress playing the mother, Sarah, glanced at him nervously and improvised a line to bring him back on track.

David’s hand shot out, grabbing Sarah’s wrist with a force that made her yelp. The audience chuckled, assuming it was part of the act. But when he twisted her arm at an unnatural angle, a sickening snap echoed through the studio. Sarah let out a scream as she fell to her knees, clutching her shattered arm. David’s face was twisted into a hideous grin, his eyes glassy and unseeing, almost as if he were looking through her.

The laughter in the audience died down, replaced by horrified whispers. Some thought it was a twisted joke; others began to realize something was terribly wrong. Before anyone could react, David reached down, grabbing a prop lamp from the set and bringing it down on Sarah’s head with a sickening crunch. The actress crumpled, her blood pooling on the fake living room carpet.

Panic erupted in the studio as the audience members scrambled for the exits, but the doors wouldn’t budge. They were locked in.

Meanwhile, Lily, the young actress playing the daughter, was frozen in shock. She watched in horror as David turned his attention to her, his face contorted in a mix of rage and something darker, something unnatural. She didn’t recognize the man she’d worked alongside for years; his presence was suffocating, like he had become something… else.

Lily stumbled back, knocking over a fake plant as she tried to put distance between herself and David. Her breath came in short, panicked gasps as he took slow, deliberate steps toward her, dragging the bloodied lamp along the floor. She bolted behind the scenes, weaving through the set’s dark corridors, her heart pounding like a drum. She could hear David’s footsteps echoing in the empty space, a relentless, steady rhythm.

As she rounded a corner, she found herself in a small storage area filled with spare props and costume racks. And there, slumped against the wall, was Tim, the actor who played her on-screen brother. His throat was slit, his lifeless eyes staring at nothing. Lily slapped a hand over her mouth to muffle her scream, her stomach churning at the sight.

David’s voice echoed through the set, low and mocking, almost sing-song, as he called out for her. “Come out, sweetheart. Daddy just wants to talk…”

Holding her breath, Lily edged past Tim’s corpse, her only thought to find a way out. She knew the studio layout well, and if she could make it past the audience seating, she might reach an exit. She crept back toward the main stage, but her foot slipped on something wet, and she nearly fell.

The front row of the audience was littered with bodies. Men and women, slumped over each other, their faces twisted in expressions of terror. The flickering lights above revealed blood splattered across their clothes, pooling beneath the seats.

A strangled cry escaped her throat, and she looked up to see David standing at the edge of the set, his head cocked to one side, watching her like a predator. His face was smeared with blood, his eyes shining with a twisted joy.

Lily bolted toward the side of the stage, her hands scrambling to push past props and equipment. David was close now; she could hear his ragged breathing, could feel the cold weight of his gaze on the back of her neck.

Finally, she saw a faint red glow—the illuminated “EXIT” sign above a door just past the rows of silent, lifeless audience members. She ran for it, her pulse roaring in her ears, her whole body screaming in terror.

With one final burst of energy, she reached the door and pushed it open, stumbling into the cold night air. She didn’t stop running, even as she heard the door slam shut behind her. Somewhere inside, David’s laughter echoed, a sound that would haunt her for the rest of her life.

When the police arrived hours later, they found the studio empty, the bodies of the cast, crew, and audience littered across the set. And though David’s blood-soaked costume was found neatly folded in the middle of the stage, there was no trace of the man himself. ”
